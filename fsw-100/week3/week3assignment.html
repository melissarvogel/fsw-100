		<p>LANGLEY, VA - A report realeased Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the
			<br>CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with Black
			<br>highlighters.
		</p>

		<p>
			According to the report, sections of documents - "almost invariably the most crucial passages" - are marred
			<br>by an inedible black ink that renders the lines almost impossible to read, t\due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
			<br>began at the agency's inseption in 1947.
		</p>
		<p>
			CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented that fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several
			<br>historic events such as:
		</p>
        
        <ul class="the-list">
			<li>the Cold War</li>
			<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
			<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
		</ul>
